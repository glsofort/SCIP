Important Notes
For Manta INS and BND variants: the Read Depth and Mapping Quality section is not applicable. The Anomalous Reads section is experimental. 
Users are encouraged to double check those variants in IGV.
In the External and Internal Variant Databases section, CNVs in the opposite direction of the analyzed variant (e.g., DELs when the analyzed variant is a DUP) are not shown.
In the Genomic Neighbourhood section, ClinGen HI/TS regions/genes that do not overlap the analyzed variant are not shown. For DELs, TS information are not displayed.

Read Depth
Click the "Update Read Depth" button above to show read depth. For larger variants, setting bin size to 5 kb or larger (before clicking the button) is recommended for faster performance.
This section is not applicable for INS or BND type variants.
Mapping Quality
Click the "Update Mapping Quality" button above to show mapping quality. For larger variants, setting bin size to 5 kb or larger (before clicking the button) is recommended for faster performance.
